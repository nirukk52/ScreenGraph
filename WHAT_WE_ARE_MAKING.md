# What We Are Making

**ScreenGraph: An Autonomous Mobile App Exploration Platform**

## The Vision

We are building **ScreenGraph** — a system that autonomously explores mobile applications and generates a living graph of every screen, action, and transition within an app. Think of it as creating a complete "map" of a mobile app without human intervention.

## What It Does

An AI-powered **agent** connects to a mobile device (via Appium), launches an app, and systematically explores it by:

1. **Capturing** screenshots and UI hierarchies at each step
2. **Understanding** what actions are possible (buttons, inputs, gestures)
3. **Executing** those actions (taps, swipes, text input)
4. **Detecting** when the app transitions to new screens
5. **Building** a persistent graph of unique screens and the edges (actions) that connect them

The result: A complete, replayable map of the app's structure that can be visualized, analyzed, and used for automated testing, UX analysis, or competitive research.

## How It Works

### Architecture

**Backend (Encore.ts):**
- **Agent Orchestrator**: XState-driven state machine that coordinates exploration
- **17 Pure Nodes**: Deterministic functions for Perceive → Act → Verify → Persist → Continue
- **Event Sourcing**: Every decision and action is recorded as an immutable event
- **State Snapshots**: Enables replay and resume from any point
- **Type-Safe API**: Full end-to-end type safety via Encore generated clients

**Frontend (SvelteKit):**
- **Timeline UI**: Real-time visualization of agent execution
- **Graph Visualization**: Interactive exploration of discovered screens
- **Run Management**: Start, monitor, and cancel exploration runs

### Core Principles

- **Deterministic**: Same inputs produce identical outputs (seeded RNG, replayable)
- **ID-First State**: State stores only references; heavy artifacts (screenshots, XML) live in object storage
- **Single Writer**: Orchestrator is the only component that writes events
- **Pure Nodes**: All agent logic is side-effect-free; I/O happens via ports/adapters
- **Enterprise-Grade**: Full replay capability, audit trails, and drift detection

## What Makes This Special

Unlike traditional mobile testing tools that require scripts, ScreenGraph:

- **Autonomously discovers** the entire app structure without human guidance
- **Builds a persistent graph** that grows across runs and can be queried
- **Records everything** as replayable events for debugging and analysis
- **Handles errors gracefully** with retries, backtracking, and recovery nodes
- **Scales horizontally** through event-driven architecture and worker pools

## Current State

✅ **Complete**: Agent orchestration infrastructure, structured logging, type-safe APIs, event sourcing  
🟡 **In Progress**: Node handler implementation, main loop execution  
⏳ **Upcoming**: LLM integration for action selection, graph visualization UI, multi-policy exploration

## The End Goal

ScreenGraph becomes the **definitive source of truth** for mobile app structure. Teams can:

- **Understand** app complexity through interactive graph visualization
- **Detect UX drift** by comparing graphs across app versions
- **Automate testing** using the discovered graph as a test suite foundation
- **Compare competitors** by analyzing their app structures side-by-side
- **Onboard faster** with visual exploration guides for new team members

We're not just building a testing tool — we're creating a **living, evolving map** of the mobile app universe.
