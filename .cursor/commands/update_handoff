Update the appropriate handoff document (BACKEND_HANDOFF.md or FRONTEND_HANDOFF.md) with your current work status.

Follow the handoff template:
- **What I am doing**: Describe the current task
- **What is pending**: Checklist of code/tests/manual review
- **What I plan to do next**: Next steps
- **Modules I am touching**: Files/paths being modified
- **Work status rating (out of 5)**: 0-5 rating
- **Graphiti episode IDs**: Memory system IDs (if available)
- **Related docs**: Relevant documentation paths
- **Notes for next agent**: Context and recommendations

Add a new handoff section with an incremented number, and mark previous handoffs as completed if they are done.
