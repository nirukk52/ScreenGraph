You will create a comprehensive summary of rules, facts, procedures and preferences 
established during the session/milestone/chat/task/todo/bug and update Graphiti MCP Memory System.

After the memories are created add the ids into any running handoff documents known to you.

If the graphiti memory system is down you will create a session_summary.md with a logical name
and alert the user by using exccesive RED DANGER emojis in your reply.
