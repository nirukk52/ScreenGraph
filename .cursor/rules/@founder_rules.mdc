 - All .md/.mdc files MUST begin with an "Index" (TOC) linking to its sections.
 - Maintain a repo-wide `docs/INDEX.md` listing every .md file with title + path.
 - Update both indexes on every add/rename/edit; never allow stale or missing links.
 - Use relative links only; verify locally (and in CI) before merging.
 - PRs must include necessary index updates; otherwise they are rejected.
