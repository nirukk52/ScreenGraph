# Founder Rules

## Package Manager Consistency
- **Use Bun consistently across the entire monorepo**
- Frontend should use `bun run dev` instead of `npm run dev`
- Backend already uses Bun (`"packageManager": "bun"`)
- Remove `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` from frontend
- Run `bun install` in frontend directory for consistency

## Why Bun Over npm
1. **Faster**: Significantly faster than npm for installs and script execution
2. **Consistency**: Single package manager for entire monorepo
3. **Performance**: Better TypeScript compilation and hot reload
4. **Toolchain**: One unified toolchain instead of mixing npm and Bun

## Implementation
```bash
# Switch frontend to Bun
cd frontend
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
bun install
bun run dev  # Instead of npm run dev
```

## Project Structure
- Root: Bun lockfile (`bun.lock`)
- Backend: Bun package manager
- Frontend: Should use Bun (not npm)
- Single consistent toolchain across entire monorepo
