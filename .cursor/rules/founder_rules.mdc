# Founder Rules
Architecture & Boundary Rules
Backend (backend/) and frontend (frontend/) are completely independent services.
No root-level coupling: root only holds docs and Git config.
No shared code or node_modules between backend and frontend.
No root package.json or encore.app`.
Backend never imports frontend; frontend never touches backend code.

Non Negotiable Coding Rules:
Every function class enum dto will have a comment about his purpose in the codebase.
Absolutely no use of any is allowed in the codebase.
Every class, function, or API endpoint must explicitly use typed DTOs (Data Transfer Objects).
DTOs must be defined at the top of the file or imported from a shared contracts or types package.
If dynamic data is expected, define a union or discriminated type instead of fallback to any.
Temporary “loose” types must still be represented as { [key: string]: unknown } or Record<string, unknown> — never any.
No magic strings for identifiers or states — define literal unions or enums.
Prefer discriminated unions or enums over free-form string comparisons in control flow.
NO MAGIC STRINGS!
NO MAGIC NUMBERS!

Type Safety Rules
Always use Encore generated clients (~encore/clients).
Never use manual fetch() calls.
After backend API changes → run bun run gen on frontend.
Generated clients guarantee full end-to-end type safety.

Package Management
Use Bun everywhere ("packageManager": "bun").
Each sub-directory manages its own dependencies.

Testing:
You test for flow reliability, correctness, and creative consistency, not just functional output.

Commands:
Backend: encore run
Frontend: bun run dev

Build & Deployment Rules
Backend builds via Encore Cloud CI (don’t script builds manually).
Frontend builds with vite build.
Deploy independently (Encore Cloud for backend, Vercel for frontend).

Run Discipline
cd backend && encore run
cd frontend && bun run dev

Absolute Prohibitions
No root package.json
No root encore.app
No shared node_modules
No backend↔frontend imports
No manual HTTP fetches

Why This Matters
Isolation → Clean Deployment
Type Safety → Zero API Drift
Encapsulation → Predictable CI
Clarity → Easy Onboarding & Maintenance
