## Part I: Core Coding Standards (ALWAYS)

### 🏗️ Architecture & Boundaries

**Backend/Frontend Separation:**
- Backend (`backend/`) and frontend (`frontend/`) are completely independent services
- No shared code or `node_modules` between them
- No root `package.json` or `encore.app`
- Backend never imports frontend; frontend never touches backend code
- No root-level coupling: root only holds docs and Git config

**Directory Structure:**
```
/ScreenGraph
├── backend/          ← Encore backend (independent)
│   ├── encore.app
│   ├── package.json
│   └── bun.lock
├── frontend/         ← SvelteKit frontend (independent)
│   ├── package.json
│   └── bun.lock
└── README.md         ← Docs, shared tsconfig, biome config
```

**Absolute Prohibitions (FR-018 harness exception noted):**
- ⚠️ Root `package.json` ONLY allowed for dev-only orchestration harnesses (e.g., Turborepo). Requirements:
  - Must be marked `"private": true`
  - May contain **devDependencies** only (no shared runtime deps)
  - Must reference backend/frontend via workspace paths without linking `node_modules`
  - Must delegate QA/lint/typecheck to existing Taskfile/Turborepo scripts so guardrails remain identical
- ❌ No root encore.app
- ❌ No shared node_modules
- ❌ No backend↔frontend imports
- ❌ No manual HTTP fetches (use Encore generated clients)

---

### 📛 Naming Conventions (CRITICAL)

**Function names MUST be descriptive verb phrases:**
- ✅ `calculateTotalPrice`, `fetchUserProfile`, `saveScreenshot`, `handleDeviceConnection`
- ❌ `handle()`, `process()`, `doStuff()`, `manager()`

**Class names MUST be singular nouns or noun phrases:**
- ✅ `ScreenGraphProjector`, `AgentOrchestrator`, `RunEventPublisher`
- ❌ `Hasher`, `Mapper`, `Processor`, `Manager` (too generic)

**Domain-oriented, not tech-oriented:**
- ✅ `ScreenHasher`, `RunEventMapper`, `AgentStateProcessor`
- ❌ `Hasher`, `Mapper`, `Processor` (missing business context)

---

### 🔒 Type Safety (NO EXCEPTIONS)

**Absolutely NO `any` type:**
- Every function, class, API endpoint MUST use explicit types
- DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) defined at top of file or imported
- Dynamic data → `Record<string, unknown>` or `{ [key: string]: unknown }`
- Never fallback to `any`

**Typed APIs:**
- Always use Encore generated clients (`~encore/clients`)
- Never manual `fetch()` calls
- After backend changes → run `bun run gen` on frontend
- Full end-to-end type safety guaranteed

**Encore.ts TypeScript Limitations:**
- ❌ **NO indexed access types**: `(typeof ARRAY)[number]` NOT supported by Encore parser
- ✅ **Use explicit literal unions instead**:

```typescript
// ❌ BAD: Encore parser fails on indexed access
export const STATUSES = ["pending", "active", "completed"] as const;
export type Status = (typeof STATUSES)[number];

// ✅ GOOD: Explicit literal union, then typed array
export type Status = "pending" | "active" | "completed";
export const STATUSES: readonly Status[] = ["pending", "active", "completed"];
```

**Examples:**
```typescript
interface StartRunRequest { appId: string; deviceId: string; policy?: "breadth" | "depth"; }
function startRun(req: StartRunRequest): Promise<RunResponse> {}
// BAD: avoid `any`
```

---

### 📝 Documentation & Comments

**Every function, class, enum, DTO MUST have a purpose comment:**
```typescript
/** Calculates perceptual hash of a screenshot for deduplication. */
export function calculateScreenHash(image: Buffer): string {}
```

---

### 🚫 No Magic Strings/Numbers

**Define literal unions or enums:**
```typescript
type AgentStatus = "idle" | "planning" | "acting" | "completed";
const RUN_STATUS = { ACTIVE: "active", CANCELED: "canceled", COMPLETED: "completed" } as const;
if (status === RUN_STATUS.ACTIVE) { /* ... */ }
```

---

### 🌍 Spelling & Language

**Use American English exclusively:**
- ✅ `canceled`, `color`, `optimize`, `initialize`
- ❌ `cancelled`, `colour`, `optimise`, `initialise`

**Applies to:** variable names, function names, enums, DB columns, types, comments, docs

---

### 📊 Logging Standards

**Use ONLY `encore.dev/log` (NEVER `console.log`):**
```typescript
import log from "encore.dev/log";

const logger = log.with({ module: "agent", actor: "worker", runId: "abc123" });
logger.info("state transition", { from: "idle", to: "planning" });
logger.error("device connection failed", { err: error.message, deviceId });
```

**Required fields:** `module`, `actor`, `runId` (when applicable)  
**On failures:** Include `stopReason` and `err.*` fields  
**Always structured JSON** — never unstructured strings

---

### 🧪 Testing Philosophy

**Test for flow reliability and correctness:**
- High-level flow tests (not edge cases or petty tests)
- Focus on creative consistency
- Verify end-to-end behavior

**Commands:**
- Backend: `encore test`
- Frontend: `bun run test`

---

### 🎯 API Clients

**Always use Encore generated clients:**
```typescript
import { run } from '~encore/clients';
const result = await run.start({ appId: 'com.example' });
// BAD: manual fetch
```

**Workflow:**
1. Update backend API endpoint
2. Run `bun run gen` in frontend
3. Use new types in frontend code
4. Full type safety end-to-end

---

### 📦 Package Management

**Use Bun exclusively:**
- All projects: `"packageManager": "bun"`
- Backend: `cd backend && bun install`
- Frontend: `cd frontend && bun install`

---

### 🚀 Commands

**Backend:**
```bash
cd backend && encore run
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend && bun run dev
```

**NEVER run from root** — always `cd` into service directory

**Skills vs Commands:**
- Deterministic automation lives in `.cursor/commands` and underlying scripts; treat them as the single source for repeatable shell workflows.
- `.claude-skills` entries describe conversational playbooks for Claude/or any other coding agent (Like You); they may call Task commands and MCP tools, but their job is human-facing orchestration and analysis.
- Add new rules about skill vs command usage here as soon as a workflow becomes canonical so the whole team stays aligned.
- Rule definition files must end with `_rules`; skill directories must end with `_skill` (the internal `SKILL.md` stays as-is); Task command descriptions in `.cursor/commands` must be natural language phrases of five words or fewer.
- If suffixing a document or skill cleanly isn’t possible, fold its content into the appropriate consolidated artifact instead of forcing an exception.

---

### 🌐 Build & Deployment

**Backend:** Encore Cloud CI (no manual build scripts)  
**Frontend:** `vite build` → Deploy to Vercel  
**Deploy independently** — backend and frontend are separate

---

### 📋 Handoff Documentation

**Maintain these files at root:**
- `BACKEND_HANDOFF.md` — Backend architecture summary
- `FRONTEND_HANDOFF.md` — Frontend architecture summary

Update after significant changes.

---

### 🎭 Vibe Usage (Engineering Personas)

**ALWAYS load appropriate vibe before starting domain-specific work:**

**What are vibes?**
- Role-based profiles that configure AI agents with domain-specific MCP tools, documentation, Task commands, and workflow patterns
- Every vibe extends `base_vibe` (graphiti, context7, sequential-thinking)
- Located in `vibes/` directory

**Available Vibes:**
- **backend_vibe** — Backend/API work (encore-mcp, github, backend-debugging)
- **frontend_vibe** — Frontend/UI work (playwright, svelte, figma, vercel)
- **infra_vibe** — DevOps/automation (mcp-builder, skill-creator, github, vercel)
- **qa_vibe** — Testing/QA (playwright, encore-mcp, webapp-testing)

**Mandatory Workflow:**
```
1. BEFORE starting work: Load appropriate vibe
   "Load backend_vibe and [task]"
   "Load frontend_vibe and [task]"
   
2. DURING work:
   - Use vibe-specific MCP tools (not manual scripting)
   - Follow vibe-specific rules and documentation
   - Run vibe-recommended Task commands
   - Leverage vibe-specific Claude skills
   
3. AFTER completing:
   - Run quality checks (founder rules, tests, smoke tests)
   - Document discoveries via Graphiti
   - Update handoff docs if significant changes
```

**Examples:**
```
✅ "Load backend_vibe and optimize agent state machine"
   → Uses encore-mcp for introspection, backend-debugging skill

✅ "Load frontend_vibe and build navigation component"
   → Uses playwright for inspection, svelte docs, autofixer

✅ "Load qa_vibe and write E2E tests for run flow"
   → Uses webapp-testing skill, playwright automation

✅ "Load infra_vibe and create Stripe MCP server"
   → Uses @mcp-builder_skill 4-phase process
```

**MCP Tools Registry:**
- **Location:** `.cursor/mcp.json` (template) and `.cursor/mcp.local.json` (secrets, gitignored)
- All vibes reference tools from this registry
- To add new tool: Update mcp.json → Update relevant vibe → Document in Graphiti

**Enforcement:**
- ❌ Never work without loading appropriate vibe (you'll miss critical tools/context)
- ❌ Never ignore vibe-specific rules (they ensure consistency)
- ❌ Never skip Graphiti search before implementing (avoid reinventing)
- ✅ ALWAYS search Graphiti for existing patterns before starting
- ✅ ALWAYS document solutions via Graphiti after solving complex issues
- ✅ ALWAYS use vibe-specific MCP tools instead of manual work

**See:** `vibes/README.md` for complete vibe documentation and decision tree

## Part II: Environment Policy

### Single Environment Execution
- All local development uses the shared `.env` file checked into the repo.
- Standard ports: backend 4000, frontend 5173, dashboard 9400, appium 4723.
- Do not customize ports per worktree; treat `.env` as the source of truth.

### Worktree Usage
- Worktrees are for parallel code editing only. Run full tests/smoke checks on the main tree.
- Do not rely on worktree-specific automation (port offsets, isolation scripts, etc.).

### Standard Dev Commands
```bash
bun run dev          # Turborepo harness → backend + frontend
cd backend && encore run   # Service-specific when needed
cd frontend && bun run dev # Service-specific when needed
```

### Services & Ports
- Scripts `./automation/scripts/dev-backend.sh` and `./automation/scripts/dev-frontend.sh` respect `.env` values.
- Husky/CI always start services on the standard ports defined above.
