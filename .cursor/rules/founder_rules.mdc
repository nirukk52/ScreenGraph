# Founder Rules
Architecture & Boundary Rules
Backend (backend/) and frontend (frontend/) are completely independent services.
No root-level coupling: root only holds docs and Git config.
No shared code or node_modules between backend and frontend.
No root package.json or encore.app`.
Backend never imports frontend; frontend never touches backend code.

Coding Rules:
Every function class enum dto will have a comment about his purpose in the codebase.

Type Safety Rules
Always use Encore generated clients (~encore/clients).
Never use manual fetch() calls.
After backend API changes → run bun run gen on frontend.
Generated clients guarantee full end-to-end type safety.

Package Management
Use Bun everywhere ("packageManager": "bun").
Each sub-directory manages its own dependencies.

Commands:
Backend: encore run
Frontend: bun run dev

Directory Structure
/ScreenGraph
├── backend/   ← Encore backend (independent)
│   ├── encore.app
│   ├── package.json
│   └── bun.lock
├── frontend/  ← SvelteKit frontend (independent)
│   ├── package.json
│   └── bun.lock
└── README.md  ← Docs only

Build & Deployment Rules
Backend builds via Encore Cloud CI (don’t script builds manually).
Frontend builds with vite build.
Deploy independently (Encore Cloud for backend, Vercel for frontend).

Run Discipline
cd backend && encore run
cd frontend && bun run dev

Absolute Prohibitions
No root package.json
No root encore.app
No shared node_modules
No backend↔frontend imports
No manual HTTP fetches

Why This Matters
Isolation → Clean Deployment
Type Safety → Zero API Drift
Encapsulation → Predictable CI
Clarity → Easy Onboarding & Maintenance
