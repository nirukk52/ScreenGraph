**Documents Created**: 17  
**Lines Written**: ~3,500

## Notes

**Learnings**:
- Writing comprehensive docs takes longer than expected (but worth it!)
- Forced clarity on architecture — rules doc revealed gaps in thinking
- Glossary is incredibly valuable for consistent terminology

**What Worked**:
- Starting with structure (README, config) before diving into content
- Writing rules first, then facts, then preferences (logical order)
- Taking time to make analysis thorough (seed.md comparison)

**What to Improve**:
- Could have batched similar docs (all rules together)
- Should have set time limits to avoid perfectionism
- Need to remember: docs are living, don't have to be perfect on v1

**Archive Policy**: Move completed tasks here weekly. Keep last 2 weeks visible, archive older to `completed-archive/YYYY-MM.md` monthly.
