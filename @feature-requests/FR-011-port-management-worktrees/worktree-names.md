## Worktree Naming Policy & Mapping

### Policy
- Each worktree must have a clear, natural-language name tied to the feature.
- Suggested format: `<Feature> — <Qualifier>` (concise, memorable).
- Names are used in status reports and discussions; keep them professional.

### Current Mapping (update as needed)
- vbKGG → Port Management — Vector Bay (proposed)
- JKEcU → Port Management — Jet Key Edge (placeholder; update by owner)
