## Summary
[Brief description: what needs to be refactored, why it's technical debt, impact if not addressed]

---

## Current State (Problems)
- [Problem 1: maintainability issue]
- [Problem 2: performance issue]
- [Problem 3: code quality issue]

---

## Desired State (After Refactoring)
- [Improvement 1]
- [Improvement 2]
- [Improvement 3]

---

## Why This Matters
- **Maintainability**: [Impact on future development]
- **Performance**: [Impact on system performance]
- **Code Quality**: [Impact on codebase health]
- **Risk**: [What breaks if we don't fix this]

---

## Refactoring Approach
