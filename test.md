# Merge Conflict Test

## Purpose
Testing how Leap handles merge conflicts when there are changes on the main branch in GitHub.

## What We're Testing
1. **Create a test file in Leap** (this file)
2. **Push changes to a different branch or main from local/Cursor**
3. **Try to merge in Leap UI** and observe what happens
4. **Document the behavior** when conflicts occur

## Expected Scenarios

### Scenario A: No Conflicts
- Leap merges successfully
- Changes appear in GitHub

### Scenario B: Conflicts Exist
- Leap shows an error or warning
- Conflict markers may appear in files
- Need to resolve manually

## Next Steps
1. Edit this file in Cursor/local environment
2. Push changes to GitHub main
3. Also edit this file in Leap (create a conflict)
4. Click Merge in Leap
5. Document what happens

## Results
_To be filled in after testing..._
