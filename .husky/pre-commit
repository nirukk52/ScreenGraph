# Husky pre-commit hook
# Validation QA suite BEFORE commit (coding agent safety)
# 
# WHY REDUNDANT: Coding agents can bypass guards and commit directly.
# Running qa:all here ensures quality checks at EVERY commit.
#
# IMPORTANT: qa:all is VALIDATION ONLY (does not modify code)
# To auto-fix before committing, run: cd .cursor && task qa:all:fix
# This will fix issues, show you the changes, and let you stage them.
